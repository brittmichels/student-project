# Introduction

Hello! If you are here, probably you are doing a BSc/MSc/PhD project with me (Veronika). I'm excited to be working together! :sparkles:

This goal of this repository is to help you be successful as a student, and to help me be successful as a supervisor. 

Since I have just started writing this guide in January 2019, it is not yet complete. My hope for it is to cover the following topics:

* Onboarding - getting started with your project
* Expectations - what I expect from you and what you can expect from me
* Vision - my view on what we should research, and how to do it
* Lab organization - meetings, communication etc 
* Literature - papers I recommend that you read
* Tips - writing papers, giving presentations etc. 

This repository is meant to be a living thing which changes after each student project. I therefore invite any comments or suggestions (via pull requests or email). 




# Onboarding

This sections contains a number of things that should happen in the first few weeks of your project. 

## Logistics

Before we get started I'd like to ask you to:

* Fill in any necessary forms and ask me to sign them
* Create a Github account and send me your Github username 
* Send me your picture (for the TU/e website)
* Review the list of things I have to do, and remind me if I missed anything

I will do the following:

* Add you to Slack (chat) 
* Send an email with a CC to you, asking for a computer for you
* Send an email with a CC to you, asking for a server account for you
* Add you to the IMAG/e website and my own website


## Problem definition

Based on our initial discussion and the first papers that you've read, create an initial problem definition that captures your understanding of the thesisâ€™ goals.

* description of problem
* research question 
* possible approach to a solution
* what a first prototype might be
* rough schedule 

Write this down in README.MD before the next weekly meeting. This description is not final and may change throughout your project. 

## Literature 

Decide on where you are going to keep track of literature. This can be a Google Sheets file, Zotero, Jabref + Evernote or a simple CSV file in Github. Do not add Word or Excel files to Github since these cannot be version controlled. 

When you read any paper, add it to your list, and write down a few notes with a summary of the paper, and how it is relevant (or not) for your thesis. This will also help you with writing your thesis later.

Find 2-4 papers for your topic and summarize them in this system. Show your setup to me in the next weekly meeting. 

## Lab notebook

Decide on where you are going to keep your lab notebook. This can be an .MD file on Github, a Google doc file, Evernote, etc. Do not add Word or Excel files to Github since these cannot be version controlled. 

Consider it like a captain's log on a ship. Every day you work on the project, you write what you did, what didn't work, why you decided 
to try something else, a screenshot of the results, etc. 

The notebook is for yourself, but you can bring it to the meeting to discuss problems and results. Also the notebook will help your future self to figure out what you did when you want to write your thesis. Show your setup to me in the next weekly meeting. 


## Todo list

Decide on where you are going to track of all your tasks. This can be on Github (via issues or projects), Todoist, Trello, or a paper planner. Make a habit of creating tasks for yourself, such that each task can be completed in a few hours. This means the task has to have a verb, and have a definition of "complete". For example, "Summarize 5 papers on topic X". 

If a todo comes up for you during the meeting, capture it straight away - either in your system, or write it on paper and add it to your system later. Show your setup to me in the next weekly meeting.
